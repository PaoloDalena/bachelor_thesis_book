# Preface to the English version {-} 

<img src="cover.png" width="250" height="328" align="right" alt="" class="cover" /> This is the English version of my Bachelor Thesis **"TEXT MINING SU SORGENTI DI TESTO COMPLESSE: ANALISI DELLE CONSIDERAZIONI FINALI DEL GOVERNATORE SULLE RELAZIONI ANNUALI DELLA BANCA D'ITALIA DAL 2008 AL 2017"** that I wrote for the [Bachelor in Statistical Sciences](https://corsi.unibo.it/1cycle/StatisticalSciences) degree I received on July 10, 2019 at [Alma Mater Studiorium - University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/homepage).  
You can find the link to the Github page of my workflow [here](https://github.com/PaoloDalena/tesi) and the official published documents [here](https://github.com/PaoloDalena/tesi/tree/master/Tesi_docs).  
Everything, for obvious reasons, is in Italian, so this online book is born to allow more people to understand my work.  
**Please note that the text has been automatically translated, so it's quite likely to find any linguistic (and other) inaccuracies.**  
If you find anything wrong, please report it [here](https://github.com/PaoloDalena/bachelor_thesis_book/issues). I will be happy to help you understand or (more likely) correct the errors.
