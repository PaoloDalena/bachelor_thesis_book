<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Annual Reports of the Bank of Italy</h2>
<p>The Bank of Italy is the central bank of the Italian Republic, with its headquarters in Rome and secondary offices and branches throughout Italy. It is a public-law institution governed by national and European regulations. It is an integral part of the Eurosystem, consisting of the national central banks of the euro area and the European Central Bank.
The Eurosystem and the central banks of the EU Member States that have not adopted the euro make up the European System of Central Banks It pursues purposes of general interest in the monetary and financial sector: the maintenance of price stability, the stability and efficiency of the financial system and other tasks entrusted to it by national law.
The Bank’s functional and governance structure reflects the need to rigorously protect its independence from external influences, an essential prerequisite for the effective performance of its institutional action. National and European regulations guarantee the autonomy necessary to pursue the mandate; this autonomy is backed up by stringent duties of transparency and publicity. The Bank is accountable to the Government, Parliament and the public for its work through the dissemination of data and information on institutional activities and the use of resources.
The publications of the Bank of Italy reflect the activities carried out by the Institute. They are of an economic-financial, historical and legal nature and are all free of charge and available online. Among these, the one that best provides a concise presentation of the country’s economic situation is undoubtedly the Annual Report. The latter is published every year at the end of May and contains an in-depth analysis of the main developments in the Italian and international economy in the previous year and in the first months of the current year and is accompanied by a statistical appendix that is only available online. It is also the subject, in a public meeting not limited to Participants, of Considerations by the Governor of the Bank of Italy.
This publication can be defined as a true analytical and informative consultancy on the state of the economy that the Bank of Italy offers to constitutional bodies in matters of economic and financial policy. By virtue of this, it is easy to understand the importance of the Annual Report and how much its content constitutes a perfect summary framework to be used as the basis for a study of the Italian economic situation and its evolution over time.</p>
