<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>In the era of the digital revolution, of frenetic computerization and of the growing and almost annoying presence of the words Intelligence and Artificial in our daily lives, the application of automatic techniques to accompany the comprehension and interpretation of official texts is indisputably topical. In fact, such methods present almost boundless potentialities and their use, although not in-depth, cannot but constitute a good practice that is likely to be interesting.
We have chosen to study the Final Considerations of the Governor on the Annual Reports of the Bank of Italy referring to the years 2008 to 2017, analyzing their style and language, the themes dealt with and the opinions expressed. The description of the data and the reasons behind this choice, together with the presentation of text mining techniques, are dealt with in the following paragraphs of this chapter. In the following one, the objectives of the study are explained. In the third chapter, the methods by which the analysis was carried out are presented in detail. The fourth chapter contains the exposition of the results obtained correlated to their interpretation. In the conclusion section, the study is summarized and critical issues are described.
All the functions created and used, together with the data analyzed, the graphs created, the software used, all the code necessary for the analysis organized by topic, and everything that was useful to complete this work is easily and freely available through my GitHub, in the thesis folder.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Annual Reports of the Bank of Italy</h2>
<p>The Bank of Italy is the central bank of the Italian Republic, with its headquarters in Rome and secondary offices and branches throughout Italy. It is a public-law institution governed by national and European regulations. It is an integral part of the Eurosystem, consisting of the national central banks of the euro area and the European Central Bank.
The Eurosystem and the central banks of the EU Member States that have not adopted the euro make up the European System of Central Banks It pursues purposes of general interest in the monetary and financial sector: the maintenance of price stability, the stability and efficiency of the financial system and other tasks entrusted to it by national law.
The Bank’s functional and governance structure reflects the need to rigorously protect its independence from external influences, an essential prerequisite for the effective performance of its institutional action. National and European regulations guarantee the autonomy necessary to pursue the mandate; this autonomy is backed up by stringent duties of transparency and publicity. The Bank is accountable to the Government, Parliament and the public for its work through the dissemination of data and information on institutional activities and the use of resources.
The publications of the Bank of Italy reflect the activities carried out by the Institute. They are of an economic-financial, historical and legal nature and are all free of charge and available online. Among these, the one that best provides a concise presentation of the country’s economic situation is undoubtedly the Annual Report. The latter is published every year at the end of May and contains an in-depth analysis of the main developments in the Italian and international economy in the previous year and in the first months of the current year and is accompanied by a statistical appendix that is only available online. It is also the subject, in a public meeting not limited to Participants, of Considerations by the Governor of the Bank of Italy.
This publication can be defined as a true analytical and informative consultancy on the state of the economy that the Bank of Italy offers to constitutional bodies in matters of economic and financial policy. By virtue of this, it is easy to understand the importance of the Annual Report and how much its content constitutes a perfect summary framework to be used as the basis for a study of the Italian economic situation and its evolution over time.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Final remarks by the Governor</h2>
<p>As already specified, the Annual Report of the Bank of Italy is discussed at a public meeting. On the occasion of its circulation, therefore, the Governor of the Bank of Italy presents the so-called Final Considerations.
The Governor of the Bank of Italy has the task of representing the bank with third parties, presiding over the meeting and informing the Italian government on foreign or domestic financial matters. Until before the introduction of the Euro, he was also responsible for national monetary policy. This function is exercised collegially together with the other central banks of the Euro area.
The Governor is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic, on the proposal of the President of the Council of Ministers, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, having heard the opinion of the Superior Council of the Bank of Italy. The procedure also applies to the revocation of the Governor. His office, which until 2005 had no term limit, lasts six years and can be renewed once.
Focusing on the period of interest to us, the Governor in office for the period 2005-2011 was Mario Draghi, who currently holds the prestigious position of President of the European Central Bank, who was succeeded on November 1, 2011 by Ignazio Visco, currently in office.
The Final Considerations referring to 2008, 2009 and 2010, therefore, were drafted by Draghi, while the subsequent seven in analysis (published up to May 2018, therefore referring to the period 2011-2017) are the result of the work of the current Governor.
These publications, available free of charge online, provide a concise and more “human” opinion of the overall economic picture of the country. They are, in fact, actual comments that the Governor is called upon to make in order to take stock of the past year.
For these and other practical reasons, related to the need to use texts as free as possible of multimedia content, we have chosen to analyze the Final Considerations of the Governor of the Bank of Italy referring to the ten years between 2008 and 2017. This will provide a clear idea of the evolution of Italy’s economic situation in the reference period from how the latter is presented in the Annual Reports.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Text mining on complex text sources</h2>
<p>Data mining is the set of techniques and methodologies that aim to extract useful information from large amounts of data, through automatic or semi-automatic methods (such as machine learning).
Text mining, also called text data mining or (in some ways incorrectly) text analytics, is a particular form of data mining in which the data consists of natural language texts, in other words “unstructured” documents. Text mining combines language technology with data mining algorithms. The goal is the same: the extraction of implicit information contained in a set of documents.
This discipline, also known by the acronym TM, therefore, deals with the search, analysis and thematic classification of information contained in documents. Unlike most of the data with which statistics works, in textual documents the information is present in the form of free text (sentences and words) and only to a small extent as structured text (tables, graphs, etc.). It must also be said that much of the communication, hence information exchange, between human beings takes place through unstructured documentation (books, newspapers, conversations).
TM is a multidisciplinary field based on different sets of techniques, grouped under the name of information retrieval, data mining, machine learning, statistics, and computational linguistics. Figure 1 shows the interactions between text mining and some of the areas presented.</p>
