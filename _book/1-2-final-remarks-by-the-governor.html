<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Final remarks by the Governor</h2>
<p>As already specified, the Annual Report of the Bank of Italy is discussed at a public meeting. On the occasion of its circulation, therefore, the Governor of the Bank of Italy presents the so-called Final Considerations.
The Governor of the Bank of Italy has the task of representing the bank with third parties, presiding over the meeting and informing the Italian government on foreign or domestic financial matters. Until before the introduction of the Euro, he was also responsible for national monetary policy. This function is exercised collegially together with the other central banks of the Euro area.
The Governor is appointed by decree of the President of the Republic, on the proposal of the President of the Council of Ministers, after deliberation by the Council of Ministers, having heard the opinion of the Superior Council of the Bank of Italy. The procedure also applies to the revocation of the Governor. His office, which until 2005 had no term limit, lasts six years and can be renewed once.
Focusing on the period of interest to us, the Governor in office for the period 2005-2011 was Mario Draghi, who currently holds the prestigious position of President of the European Central Bank, who was succeeded on November 1, 2011 by Ignazio Visco, currently in office.
The Final Considerations referring to 2008, 2009 and 2010, therefore, were drafted by Draghi, while the subsequent seven in analysis (published up to May 2018, therefore referring to the period 2011-2017) are the result of the work of the current Governor.
These publications, available free of charge online, provide a concise and more “human” opinion of the overall economic picture of the country. They are, in fact, actual comments that the Governor is called upon to make in order to take stock of the past year.
For these and other practical reasons, related to the need to use texts as free as possible of multimedia content, we have chosen to analyze the Final Considerations of the Governor of the Bank of Italy referring to the ten years between 2008 and 2017. This will provide a clear idea of the evolution of Italy’s economic situation in the reference period from how the latter is presented in the Annual Reports.</p>
